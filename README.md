# Azure-Resource-Locks
For maintaining Azure resource lock configuration and automation

These are used to protect from automation gone wrong against resources that have persistent data that we really don't want accidentally deleted.

## Resource types
Currently the resource locks are applied to *resource groups* which have the following resource types:

* Storage
* Key Vault
* SQL Databases
* APP Insights
* Static IPs 
* Azure Firewall
* SaaS Resources
* Virtual Wan
* CosmosDB
* Frontdoor 
* App Gateways 
* Private DNS Zones 

The list could be extended by adding *|| contains(type, '<<*resource type*>>'))* to the [JSONPATH](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-resource-locks/blob/056dc8882431966269951abbef2f5dd9fd727e5e/scripts/enable-resource-locking.sh#L4) in the *enable-resource-locking.sh*

## Exempt from autolocking

To avoid your resources from being auto locked, you can use the `exemptFromAutoLock` tag on the resource group:
```bash
exemptFromAutoLock = true
```
